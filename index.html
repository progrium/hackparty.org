      <h2>What is a hack party?</h2>
      <p>A hack party is simply a party where creative and curious
      people get together to hack and socialize around their projects
      and passions. They’ve been proven to build and strengthen
      communities around technology and innovation across the world.</p>

      <p>A typical hack party goes like this. Guests gather at a
      location with wifi and casual atmosphere. They bring their laptop
      or something to “hack” on (invention, art project, or maybe just
      an idea). The event typically runs all day with an open format --
      almost no schedule or agenda. Like any party, there are often
      snacks and drinks. During the peak of the event, guests are given
      the opportunity to share ideas and demos in 5 minute lightning
      talks.</p>

      <p>Hack parties create an environment that facilitates a rich set
      of emergent outcomes directed towards hands-on learning and
      building, ideation and knowledge sharing, and developing social
      capital. However, actually being able to work on or start a
      project is a key component. There as an intentional tension and
      interaction between productivity and socializing.</p>

      <p>The invisible “glue” behind hack parties is something we call
      the hacker spirit, or hacker way. This is a set of cultural values
      around passion, curiosity, and building. Hack parties amplify this
      quality in people that have it, and tend to infect it in those
      that don’t yet. Hack parties resonate hacker culture.</p>

      <h3>How is this different from a hackathon or conference?</h3>
      <p>Modern hackathons actually evolved from hack parties. The
      popularity of hackathons emerged from companies and groups that
      had a specific agenda and/or didn’t quite grok the value of hack
      parties. Hack parties were originally seen as hackathons until it
      became commonplace for hackathons to be about competitions and
      prizes around specific technologies that last 24+ hours.</p>

      <p>Although the activities of hack parties and hackathons overlap,
      there is a useful way to tell them apart. Hack parties are
      primarily about people and hacker culture, whereas hackathons are
      primarily about producing software. The former implies the latter,
      but not necessarily the other way around. Ironically, hackathons
      also seem to have less focus on the hacker culture.</p>

      <p>Hack parties may seem very different from conferences, but
      there are still functional similarities. Seasoned conference goers
      will recognize that often the real value of conferences are in the
      discussions outside of actual talks. In this view, talks primarily
      serve as the introduction to an idea and a prompt for discussion.
      The open-ended social nature of hack parties facilitates the same
      kind of discussions, often in greater variety. Lightning talks
      then provide a condensed venue for the one-to-many format of
      conference talks.</p>

      <p>Meetups and user groups are often just mini-conferences
      focusing on one or two talks. Sometimes they’re purely social.
      They’re almost always focused on a particular topic. Hack parties
      tend to be more general, and again much more hands-on and
      action-oriented.</p>

      <p>Those familiar with the hack party format tend to prefer it
      over these other kinds of events. Perhaps because there is a
      little of everything and more value on culture and community.</p>

      <h2>How do I throw a hack party?</h2>

      <p>Perhaps the most important part of hack parties is the culture
      and community. This is much harder to capture in words effectively
      while being flexible enough for interpretation, especially
      considering the variance in regional cultures. It’s very much a
      “you know it when you experience it” property.

      <p>This transfer of culture and spirit is essential to maintaining
      the integrity of hack party events. Over the years we’ve developed
      a simple way to help effectively make this transfer. We now have
      it encoded in a simple two-step social protocol we call Culture
      Clone Protocol.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Attend a hack party and get authorized</strong><br />
        You have to experience a hack party for yourself before you can
        throw your own. Getting authorized means making your intentions
        to throw an event known to an organizer and getting their
        blessing. This is a first line defense where an organizer can
        suggest to you that you should attend more events first because
        they feel you might not “get it” yet. This would be rather rare,
        but it can happen. It also helps establish a relationship with
        an organizer, which is important for the next step.</li>
        <li><strong>Pilot a hack party and get endorsed</strong><br />
        Now that you’re authorized and you’ve read up on best practices,
        you can throw a “pilot” event. A pilot event is like any other
        event, except you should have at least 2 existing organizers
        participate and assist you. It’s still your party, but they can
        act as advisors. If they feel like you’ve successfully cloned
        the hack party spirit, they will endorse your events.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Getting your hack party endorsed is official community
      recognition of you as a hack party organizer. Any future events
      you hold will also be “endorsed”. It’s a sort of seal of quality
      that helps maintain the integrity and culture behind the hack
      party pseudo-brand. An endorsed hack party can be listed on
      hackparty.org and benefits from some common infrastructure and
      marketing.</p>

      <p><strong>That said, anybody can throw a hack party, endorsed or
        not. A hack party is simply “facilitating hacking and
        socializing”.</strong></p>

      <p>If you do go the route of an endorsed hack party, there are
      only a few actual requirements, complemented by best practices and
      room for experimentation. For the essential qualities, we’ve put
      together three minimum conventions decided on from years of
      experience doing events around the world:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Facilitate bring-your-own-gear hacking</strong><br />
        The common form of hacking involves laptops, which people should
        be encouraged to bring. You should then have everything for them
        to easily get hacking. That means a place to hack, power, and
        wifi. Even if a group is predominantly hardware hackers, not
        having laptops and wifi will extremely limit the
        experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it casual, fun, and inclusive</strong><br />
        The environment should feel like a casual party that everyone is
        welcome to. Ways to achieve this include having couches around,
        providing snacks and drinks, and avoiding fluorescent lighting.
        It may mean having alcohol, being kid-friendly, or both. People
        should be comfortable, aware of bathrooms and people in charge
        of the home or facility. And everybody should be welcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Always conduct postmortems</strong><br />
        At the end of the event, there should always be a gathering of
        guests and organizers to have and document a “postmortem” or
        retrospective on the event. Discuss how people felt about the
        event, what went well, what didn’t work, and what can be tried
        next time. This means events are always improving and learning.
        Even if you hold one event, everybody will benefit from
        reflecting on the event. </li>
      </ol>

      <p>These qualities and the cultural and spiritual "vibe" are what
      endorsements are based on. Making sure you meet these standards
      and following the Culture Clone Protocol should ensure a great
      foundation for your own hack parties.</p>

      <p>Once you're endorsed, if your hack parties ever seem to stray
      too far from hack party ideals, the organizers that endorsed you
      have the option to revoke endorsement. So it’s important to stay
      involved with the organizer community and share experiments and
      iteration so that you can strike a balance in helping evolve the
      hack party definition of hacker culture, and maintaining the
      current spirit of hacker culture.</p>

      <h2>Where did the term “hack party” come from?</h2>
      <p>The name “hack party” is new, but the idea has been around for
      a while. The largest and first well known hack party is
      SuperHappyDevHouse, started in 2005 by Jeff Lindsay and David
      Weekly at David’s house in Hillsborough, California. Hack party
      was coined to describe the general idea of SuperHappyDevHouse, as
      the term “hackathon” quickly became a poor description of what it
      was. The term “hack party” is based on the tagline description of
      SuperHappyDevHouse: “A party for hackers and thinkers.”</p>

      <p>Defining hack party after DevHouse has been running for so long
      and has been duplicated a number of times (both successfully and
      not so successfully) gives those interested in organizing hack
      parties a wealth of knowledge in best practices from the
      beginning. It also provided an opportunity to formalize some of
      the ideas and experiences of what it is to be a hack party, and
      how one can best duplicate it. </p>

      <p>Relative to DevHouse, the light social process associated with
      hackparty.org is somewhat similar to the way TED has franchised
      itself with TEDx. However, hackparty.org is run as an open source
      community project. The use of “hack party” as opposed to
      “DevHouse” for this purpose was partly to relieve the general idea
      of DevHouse from the specifics of how DevHouse has evolved as an
      event and community over the years. </p>
